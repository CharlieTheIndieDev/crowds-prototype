<i>“The great triumphs and tragedies of history are caused,
not by people being fundamentally good or fundamentally bad,
but by people being fundamentally people.”</i><br>

<p>
Why is it that the <i>same</i> people, in <i>different</i> groups,
can be kind, cruel, smart, stupid?
In this explorable explanation on <b>network theory</b>,
I'll show how the <i>structure</i> of
a group itself &mdash; the "network" &mdash; can shape the people caught in its web.
</p>

<p>
How do networks change people? Here's one way: networks <i>fool</i> people.
Just like how you see the earth as flat because you're on it,
people may get wrong ideas about society because they're <i>in</i> it.
<!--They believe that since the majority of their friends do or believe a thing,
that the majority of <i>all people</i> do or believe that thing.-->
</p>

<p>
For example, consider binge-drinking among college students. 
Like all people, students look to their friends to get
a sense of what % of their peers do some behavior:
</p>

<div class="caption" style="font-size:17px;">
(connections = friendships.
thought bubbles <div class="fluffy bubble"></div> show # of binge-drinking friends, vs # of total friends.
thought bubble changes to <div class="spiky bubble"></div> when a <i>majority</i> of one's friends drink)
</div>

<iframe src="game/pre_puzzle.html" width="250" height="250"></iframe>

<p>
However, depending on the friendship network, people can be fooled into thinking
that binge-drinking is more common than it actually is.
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1758185" target="_blank">A 1991 study</a>
showed that “virtually all students reported that their friends drank more than they did”.
(which, if you think about it, is logically impossible!)
</p>

<p>
In fact, it's possible to fool <i>everyone</i> that a majority of people do X,
even if people who do X are in a minority:
</p>

<div class="caption" style="font-size:24px;">
PUZZLE GAME!
fool <i>everyone</i> into thinking a majority
<div class="spiky bubble"></div>
of their friends binge-drink:
</div>

<iframe src="game/puzzle.html" width="500" height="500"></iframe>

<p>
This is called the
<a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0147617" target="_blank">
Majority Illusion</a>, which also explains why people think their political views are a common sense consensus,
or think a rare behavior is more common than it actually is.
</p>

<p>
The Majority Illusion is just one of the many ways <b>networks shape people, for better or worse.</b>
Later, I'll flesh out this prototype to also explain 
small worlds, social contagion &amp; other ideas from the new science of human networks!
</p>

<p>
Anyway, that's the end of my prototype! Let me know what you think about
1) this thing overall
2) whether the puzzle was too hard/easy
3) any other ideas about humans/network theory you'd like me to explain.
