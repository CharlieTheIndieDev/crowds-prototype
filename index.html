not by people being fundamentally good or fundamentally bad,
but by people being fundamentally people.”</i><br>

Why is it that the <i>same</i> people, in <i>different</i> groups,
can be kind, cruel, smart, stupid?
In this explorable explanation on <b>network theory</b>,
I'll show how the <i>structure</i> of
a group itself &mdash; the "network" &mdash; can shape the people caught in its web.

How do networks change people? Here's one way: networks <i>fool</i> people.
Just like how the earth <i>looks</i> flat from where you stand on the planet,
people may get wrong ideas about society from where they are in the network.
<!--They believe that since the majority of their friends do or believe a thing,
that the majority of <i>all people</i> do or believe that thing.-->
</p>

<p>
For example, consider binge-drinking among college students. 
Blah blah blah blah (learning from friends)
</p>

<div class="caption" style="font-size:17px;">
(connections = friendships.
thought bubbles <div class="fluffy bubble"></div> show # of binge-drinking friends, out of total friends.
thought bubble changes to <div class="spiky bubble"></div> when a <i>majority</i> of one's friends drink)

<p>
Blah blah blah blah (the statistics)

<div class="caption">
fool <i>everyone</i> into thinking a majority of their friends are binge-drinkers:

blah blah blah (majority illusion in other fields)
